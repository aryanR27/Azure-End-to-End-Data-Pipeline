Overview
This project demonstrates the migration of data from an on-premises database to the cloud using Azure Data Factory for orchestration, Databricks for data processing, and Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing and analytics.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before starting the migration:

Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.
On-premises database server with data to be migrated.
Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics provisioned.
Migration Steps
Step 1: Set up Azure Resources
Provision Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics resources.
Step 2: Configure Azure Data Factory
Create a new Data Factory pipeline.
Configure linked services for on-premises and cloud databases.
Define datasets for source and destination.
Step 3: Data Movement with Azure Data Factory
Create a data flow in Azure Data Factory to move data from on-premises to cloud.
Utilize Azure Data Factory's scheduling capabilities for automation.
Step 4: Data Processing with Databricks
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data using Databricks.
Integrate Databricks notebooks or jobs into the Azure Data Factory pipeline.
Step 5: Load Data into Azure Synapse Analytics
Create tables or data structures in Azure Synapse Analytics.
Use Azure Data Factory to load processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics.
Step 6: Monitoring and Optimization
Set up monitoring for the Azure Data Factory pipeline, Databricks jobs, and Azure Synapse Analytics.
Optimize queries and processes for performance.
Testing
After completing the migration, perform the following tests:

Data Integrity Testing:

Verify data consistency between on-premises and cloud databases.
End-to-End Testing:

Validate the entire data pipeline for correctness and completeness.
Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

Authentication Issues:

Ensure that Azure credentials are correctly configured.
Data Processing Failures:

Check Databricks logs for ETL job failures.
