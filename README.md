## Overview

This project demonstrates the migration of data from an on-premises database to the cloud using Azure Data Factory for orchestration, Databricks for data processing, and Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI for data warehousing and analytics.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before starting the migration:

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.
- On-premises database server with data to be migrated.
- Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics provisioned.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Set up Azure Resources

1. Provision Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics resources.

### Step 2: Configure Azure Data Factory

1. Create a new Data Factory pipeline.
2. Configure linked services for on-premises and cloud databases.
3. Define datasets for source and destination.

### Step 3: Data Movement with Azure Data Factory

1. Create a data flow in Azure Data Factory to move data from on-premises to cloud.
2. Utilize Azure Data Factory's scheduling capabilities for automation.

### Step 4: Data Processing with Databricks

1. Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data using Databricks.
2. Integrate Databricks notebooks or jobs into the Azure Data Factory pipeline.

### Step 5: Load Data into Azure Synapse Analytics

1. Create tables or data structures in Azure Synapse Analytics.
2. Use Azure Data Factory to load processed data into Azure Synapse Analytics.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Optimization

1. Set up monitoring for the Azure Data Factory pipeline, Databricks jobs, and Azure Synapse Analytics.
2. Optimize queries and processes for performance.

## Testing

After completing the migration, perform the following tests:

- **Data Integrity Testing:**
  - Verify data consistency between on-premises and cloud databases.

- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Validate the entire data pipeline for correctness and completeness.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication Issues:**
  - Ensure that Azure credentials are correctly configured.

- **Data Processing Failures:**
  - Check Databricks logs for ETL job failures.
